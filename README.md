# Object-detection using opencv 

The aim of this project is to design an Arduino-based virtual device that acts as a third eye for the blind using python and C++ programming to help blind people navigate with greater comfort, speed, and confidence.The third eye for Blind task is a breakthrough that allows outwardly disabled people to move around and between different areas with speed and certainty by detecting nearby obstacles with the help of a worn band that emits ultrasonic waves that alert them with a buzz sound or any vibrations. 

This allows the blind to know what obstacle is present infront of them. The object detection is done using opencv python and C++ for the blind to know what obstacle is present through the ESP-32 Cam module coded with Arduino Uno accordingly for the desired requirement. The ESP-32 captures pictures through its cam module and detects the recognized object through the captured frames respectively.Also,a text-to-speech converter code is integrated using a python code and required libraries which voices over the object which is detected through the camera. And thus the voice message is generated accordingly.
